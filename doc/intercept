#Intercept #Centralizing #Bias

when we try to predict using linear regression we try to find a connection between predictors and then we draw a
linear line represent the connection.

sometimes (depends on our data) we'll have predictors with the value of 0, then it will force our line to go through
the origin (0,0,...).
it can cause bias, therefor we centralize our data + set the value of all 0's predictors to the mean Y of them.

intercept is the mean value of all X (predictor) = 0
and what if our X never = 0? we can centralize our data so the mean of all X will be 0 (just subtract a value from X)
